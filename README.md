# NumberGuessingGame
A number guessing game is a simple and engaging game where players attempt to guess a hidden number within a specified range. Hereâ€™s a basic overview of how it typically works:

Setup: The game defines a range of numbers from 1 to 100. The hidden number is randomly selected within this range by the game system.

Player Input: The player makes guesses by inputting numbers.
